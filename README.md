### MAJOR HURDLES❗❗
- Understanding and implementing the classList property
- Displaying the different classes
- Debugging and understanding how to correct them (most of time it was spelling errors/wrong variable name)
- Getting the score to equal 0 once the game was restarted
- Making sure variable names make sense to not get confused
